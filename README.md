Hello there! I'm Vikash Ranjan, a dedicated full-stack developer with a passion for crafting seamless user experiences. With an ever-curious mindset, I'm constantly on the lookout for opportunities to learn and grow in the world of technology.

### Experienced in Delivering Excellence

I bring over 2 years of front-end expertise to the table, during which I've honed my skills in crafting dynamic and engaging user interfaces. My journey has led me to dive deeper into the backend realm, where I'm harnessing the power of Spring Boot and node.js to solve complex challenges.

### Driving Innovation at Vasitum.com

Over the past 1 year, I've taken on the role of front-end lead at Vasitum.com, spearheading the development of impactful features. Whether it's enhancing the recruiter and candidate portals or developing modules like job posting, payment integration, and interview scheduling, I'm dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

### A Collaborative Leader

Currently, I'm leading a team, where I'm not only focusing on project development but also providing guidance and support to my fellow team members. I thrive on overcoming challenges, ensuring tasks are completed on time, and fostering a collaborative environment.

### My Tech Arsenal

My skills encompass a range of technologies including Next.js, Redux, and styled-components for front-end magic. On the backend, I'm well-versed in Spring Boot and node.js, coupled with MongoDB for robust data handling. I've even successfully deployed MERN stack projects, integrating seamless payment solutions and ensuring smooth operations.
